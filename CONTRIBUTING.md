Hey there, and thanks for your help. Please adhere to the [Code of Conduct][CoC] (be a [mensch](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mensch)).

There are a couple ways to get started. You can submit [bug reports](#bugs) or [feature requests](#feature-requests), or work on existing bugs/features by [claiming an issue](#claiming-an-issue). If you have any questions, [reach out to me](https://binyam.in/contact).


## Bugs
If you noticed a bug, please [submit a bug report][new_issue]. Include as much information as you think _might_ be helpful (eg. screenshots, browser version, related issues). Remember that GitHub doesn't limit the number of characters, so you can add whatever you think is necessary.

Make sure that you can recreate the bug in a fresh repository, or it'll be hard to help you. If you can, create and link to a GitHub repository that maintainers can use to debug your issue.

## Feature Requests
When there's something you want added, check [the issues log][issue_log]. If there's already an issue, but it's inactive, give it a nudge by commenting. Otherwise, [open a new issue][new_issue] explaining _what_ you want addded/changed and _why_ it's important to you. Think about both the solution, and why that solution is necessary.

## Claiming an Issue
Browse through [open issues][issue_log]. Once you've found one that you like, go ahead and leave a comment saying you're working on the issue. You can comment to ask for help as well.

When you're finished, open a pull request. Every pull request should correspond to an open issue (except for typos). Even if you already made the changes, you can create a _draft_ pull request instead, and open an issue.
